      <td width="70%" align="left">I seem to constantly get distracted by projects. Those projecs create more projects and then the cycle continues. This is probably how I ended up with more domains than I know what to do with. Please help yourself to some of the projects that I happen to have lying around. This site was created to share some of the projects with anyone who might be insterestd.</td>

<p>A special thanks to Alex Clauss for helping me design and create assets for this website. We did some fun things here, such as setting a different CSS palette depending on the time of day. I also created a custom font based on his design.</p>
